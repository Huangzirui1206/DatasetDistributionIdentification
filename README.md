### Dataset Distribution Identification

This is the official code repository for paper **Dataset Distribution Identification: Private Data Provenance in Fine-tuned LLMs via Natural Distributional Fingerprint**. 

In this paper, we propose Dataset Distribution Identification (DDI), a novel framework that enhances data management through unauthorized data usage detection and data privacy leakage assessment. Given the high value of proprietary LLM fine-tuning data and potential infringement risks, DDI plays a critical role in data curation and security for the LLM era, focusing on data provenance and infringement detection while complementing prior works with greater effectiveness and robustness. In particular, Section 5 details DDI's applications to fine-tuning data provenance and data privacy assessments, and Section 6 evaluates DDI's effectiveness, robustness, and reliability for LLM data management.

The paper is now under review of ICDE'26 Round-2.
